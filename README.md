# Where to book ðŸŽ¾ court in Raincouver?

> Where can I book a freaking tennis court in Raincouver?
> -- Tennis Buddha

This project is to answer the universal question in one place.
To rephrase it, let's build a webpage to display the court vacancies in Vancouver.

Current supported venues are

- [Burnaby - Burnaby Tennis Club](https://www.burnabytennis.ca/burnaby/home/readPage.do?id=141)
- [Richmond - Tennis BC Hub](https://clubspark.ca/TBCHubRichmond/Booking/BookByDate)
- [Vancouver - UBC](https://recreation.ubc.ca/tennis/court-booking/)
- [North Vancouver - Tennis Centre](https://www.nvrc.ca/facilities-fields/north-vancouver-tennis-centre)
- [Coquitlam - The Tennis Centre](http://coquitlam.thetenniscentre.ca/)
- [Surrey - The Tennis Centre](https://www.thetenniscentre.ca/surrey/book-court/)
- [Langley - The Tennis Centre](https://www.thetenniscentre.ca/langley/book-court/)

## Implementation notes

High level

- `bin/run` is the script to scrape venue websites and store data into `runner-data.json`. It's configured to run every 5 minutes by Github Action
- `index.html` is the static page that loads and renders the data. It's hosted by Github Pages

Details

- Scraping strategy: Prefer simple data endpoint request over login and page parsing. So, try figuring out data
  endpoint firstly, otherwise use [mechanize](https://github.com/sparklemotion/mechanize) to parse page, otherwise
  employ Selenium Web driver to enable JavaScript simulation.
- Data is actually stored in `runner-data.js` instead of `runner-data.json` to avoid CORS check, which requires JSON file to be loaded from a server.
- Data is mostly massaged in back end and served directly to front end.
- Data is sorted by `(date, start_time, end_time, court_info)`
- [mechanize](https://github.com/sparklemotion/mechanize) is the main scraping framework used.

Others

- Secrets are managed by [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv).
- Use `record: :new_episodes` to record new VCR requests

### How to add a new venue

1. Add a new entry to `venues.json`
2. Add new scraper in `lib/new_venue_scraper.rb` with test `test/new_venue_scraper_test.rb`

### Known Issues

Github Actions

The shortest interval you can run scheduled workflows with Github Actions is once every 5 minutes.
But there is no guarantee on the frequency. In practice, I noticed it's around 10 minutes on average.
